<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Music recommendation algorithms are not as efficient as users would like them to be. Great music gets buried in the shuffle of mainstream hits. We want to change that! We aim to discover your next played hit by helping you uncover hidden gems and generating a playlist based on songs you can’t stop listening to. Our objective is to give our users a personalized music experience by allowing them to make playlists that reflect their musical preferences and by creating a collaborative environment where users can share, build, and listen to music together to match their tastes.

Through app features like a voting system to select the next song, artist, and/or genre, users will be able to organize group listening sessions where they will collaborate. A user’s playlist will be personalized based on information gathered through features such as user listening history, interactive prompt suggestions that allow users to specify what genre, mood, or artists they want to listen to next, and a Tinder-like swiping feature that allows users to select the songs they enjoy. As more data is collected, user music profiles will be dynamic and constantly changing to guarantee a personalized music experience that is reflected in customized playlists and music recommendations.
